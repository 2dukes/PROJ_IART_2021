# IART - Ten Pair

To run the project you can choose either of the two options:

- Place the project inside a Web Server like Apache and then visit: <br>
```
localhost/src
```

- Or visit the [following link](https://2dukes.github.io/PROJ_IART_2021/proj1/src).

Note that if you want to run it locally it's crucial that you use a **Web Server**!

# IART - Credit Risk Analysis

The project aims to predict if a credit is risky or not. To do that we were given a Kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rameshmehta/credit-risk-analysis) that contained previous information about credits. After the dataset was processed, we trained a model with several Machine Learning algorithms such as Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors to see which would give us the best result. Data visualization libraries such as *Matplotlib* and *Searborn* were used to better represent the data. During the project's development, we also used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Numpy, and Tensorflow.
