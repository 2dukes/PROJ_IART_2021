Instructions: 

To run the project you should have python installed in your machine as well as the following libraries:
    - numpy
    - pandas
    - matplotlib
    - scikit-learn
    - tensorflow
    - scipy

You should also install Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to check our notebook.

If you wish you may only install Anaconda which does most of the hard work for you, but you should probably need to install most of the aforementioned libraries.

The dataset must be located in the resources folder under the name data.csv. Note: as the dataset is too large to submit in Moodle, to run the notebook it is necessary to download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/rameshmehta/credit-risk-analysis.
